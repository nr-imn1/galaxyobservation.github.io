<h1 style="Font-family: Times New Roman; text-decoration:underline">The Blackhole</h1>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
Black hole, cosmic body of extremely intense gravity from which nothing, not even light, can escape. 
<br>A black hole can be formed by the death of a massive star. When such a star has exhausted the internal 
<br>thermonuclear fuels in its core at the end of its life, the core becomes unstable and gravitationally 
<br>collapses inward upon itself, and the star’s outer layers are blown away. The crushing weight of 
<br>constituent matter falling in from all sides compresses the dying star to a point of zero volume and 
<br>infinite density called the singularity.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
Details of the structure of a black hole are calculated from Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity. 
<br>The singularity constitutes the centre of a black hole and is hidden by the object’s “surface,” the event 
<br>horizon. Inside the event horizon the escape velocity (i.e., the velocity required for matter to escape 
<br>from the gravitational field of a cosmic object) exceeds the speed of light, so that not even rays of light 
<br>can escape into space. The radius of the event horizon is called the Schwarzschild radius, after the German 
<br>astronomer Karl Schwarzschild, who in 1916 predicted the existence of collapsed stellar bodies that emit no 
<br>radiation. The size of the Schwarzschild radius is proportional to the mass of the collapsing star. For a black 
<br>hole with a mass 10 times as great as that of the Sun, the radius would be 30 km (18.6 miles).</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
Only the most massive stars—those of more than three solar masses—become black holes at the end of their lives. 
<br>Stars with a smaller amount of mass evolve into less compressed bodies, either white dwarfs or neutron stars.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
Black holes usually cannot be observed directly on account of both their small size and the fact that they emit no light. 
<br>They can be “observed,” however, by the effects of their enormous gravitational fields on nearby matter. For example, 
<br>if a black hole is a member of a binary star system, matter flowing into it from its companion becomes intensely heated 
<br>and then radiates X-rays copiously before entering the event horizon of the black hole and disappearing forever. One of 
<br>the component stars of the binary X-ray system Cygnus X-1 is a black hole. Discovered in 1971 in the constellation 
<br>Cygnus, this binary consists of a blue supergiant and an invisible companion 14.8 times the mass of the Sun that revolve 
<br>about one another in a period of 5.6 days.</p>
