<h1 style="Font-family: Times New Roman; text-decoration:underline">Facts about the Galaxy</h1>

<h3 style="Font-family: times new roman">1. Galaxies come in all shapes and sizes</h3>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
There are so many different types of galaxies! Spiral, elliptical, barred spiral, irregular galaxies…the 
<br>list goes on. And each type of galaxy has a different shape. For example, spiral galaxies are usually 
<br>long and thin with spiralling arms, while elliptical galaxies are more round or oval-shaped.</p>

<h3 style="Font-family: times new roman">2. Galaxies are huge!</h3>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
The Milky Way, the galaxy that Earth is a part of, is 100,000 light-years across. That means if you 
<br>travelled at the speed of light, it would take you 100,000 years to cross the Milky Way! And our 
<br>galaxy is on the small side compared to some other galaxies out there. The largest known galaxy is 
<br>IC 1101, about 6 million light-years across. That’s big enough to fit over one million Milky Way 
<br>galaxies inside of it!</p>

<h3 style="Font-family: times new roman">3. Galaxies contain billions of stars</h3>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
The average galaxy contains anywhere from a few hundred billion to a trillion stars. That’s a lot 
<br>of stars! And each star in a galaxy has its own planetary system. That means that there are billions 
<br>and billions of planets out there in the universe.</p>

<h3 style="Font-family: times new roman">4. Galaxies are held together by gravity</h3>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
The force of gravity is what keeps a galaxy together. Without gravity, the stars in a galaxy would 
<br>fly off into space. Gravity is also what keeps the planets in orbit around their stars.</p>

<h3 style="Font-family: times new roman">5. Galaxies can collide</h3>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
When two galaxies collide, it’s a really big event! These collisions can cause all kinds of interesting 
<br>things to happen, like the formation of new stars.</p>

<h3 style="Font-family: times new roman">6. Different types of galaxies</h3>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
There are three main types of galaxy: spiral, elliptical, and irregular. Like our Milky Way galaxy, 
<br>Spiral galaxies have arms that wind around a central bulge. Elliptical galaxies are shaped like 
<br>footballs, and irregular galaxy don’t have any particular shape.</p>
