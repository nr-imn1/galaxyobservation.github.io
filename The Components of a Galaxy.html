<h1 style="Font-family: Times New Roman; text-decoration:underline">The Components of a Galaxy</h1>

<h2 style="font-family: Times New Roman; text-decoration: underline">The Nucleus</h2>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
At the very centre of the Galaxy lies a remarkable object—a massive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk of high-temperature gas. 
<br>Neither the central object nor any of the material immediately around it can be observed at optical wavelengths because of the thick 
<br>screen of intervening dust in the Milky Way. The object, however, is readily detectable at radio wavelengths and has been dubbed Sagittarius A* 
<br>by radio astronomers. Somewhat similar to the centres of active galaxies (see below), though on a lesser scale, the galactic nucleus is the 
<br>site of a wide range of activity apparently powered by the black hole. Infrared radiation and X-rays are emitted from the area, and rapidly moving 
<br>gas clouds can be observed there. Data strongly indicate that material is being pulled into the black hole from outside the nuclear region, 
<br>including some gas from the z direction (i.e., perpendicular to the galactic plane). As the gas nears the black hole, the central object’s strong 
<br>gravitational force squeezes the gas into a rapidly rotating disk, which extends outward about 5–30 light-years from the black hole. Rotation 
<br>measurements of the disk and the orbital motions of stars (seen at infrared wavelengths) indicate that the black hole has a mass more than 4,000,000 
<br>times that of the Sun. (For the infrared observations that established that Sagittarius A* was a black hole, American astronomer Andrea Ghez and German 
<br>astronomer Reinhard Genzel were awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize for Physics.)</p>

<h2 style="font-family: Times New Roman; text-decoration: underline">The Central Bulge</h2>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
Surrounding the nucleus is an extended bulge of stars that is nearly spherical in shape and that consists primarily of Population II stars, though they 
<br>are comparatively rich in heavy elements. (For an explanation of Population II stars, see Stars and stellar populations.) Mixed with the stars are 
<br>several globular clusters of similar stars, and both the stars and the clusters have nearly radial orbits around the nucleus. The bulge stars can 
<br>be seen optically where they stick up above the obscuring dust of the galactic plane.</p>

<h2 style="font-family: Times New Roman; text-decoration: underline">The Disk</h2>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
From a distance the most conspicuous part of the Galaxy would be the disk, which extends from the nucleus out to approximately 75,000 light-years. 
<br>The Galaxy resembles other spiral systems, featuring as it does a bright, flat arrangement of stars and gas clouds that is spread out over 
<br>its entirety and marked by a spiral structure. The disk can be thought of as being the underlying body of stars upon which the arms are 
<br>superimposed. This body has a thickness that is roughly one-fifth its diameter, but different components have different characteristic thicknesses. 
<br>The thinnest component, often called the "thin disk," includes the dust and gas and the youngest stars, while a thicker component, the 
<br>"thick disk,” includes somewhat older stars.</p>

<h2 style="font-family: Times New Roman; text-decoration: underline">The Massive Halo</h2>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
The least-understood component of the Galaxy is the giant massive halo that is exterior to the entire visible part. The existence of 
<br>the massive halo is demonstrated by its effect on the outer rotation curve of the Galaxy (see below Mass). All that can be 
<br>said with any certainty is that the halo extends considerably beyond a distance of 100,000 light-years from the centre and that 
<br>its mass is several times greater than the mass of the rest of the Galaxy taken together. It is not known what its shape is, what 
<br>its constituents are, or how far into intergalactic space it extends.</p>
