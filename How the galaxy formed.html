<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
Astronomers know that some of the oldest galaxies observed formed when the universe was only about a billion years 
<br>old. They think those galaxies started to grow around pockets of space that were slightly denser than their
<br>surroundings, an effect created by cosmic inflation when the universe began. But when it comes to the exact order of 
<br>formation, they have a little bit of a “chicken or the egg” problem.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
Most big galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers that pack hundreds of thousands to billions of times '
<br>the Sun’s mass. A black hole weighing 4 million Suns sits in the center of our own galaxy, the Milky Way. It’s possible 
<br>that the black holes came first, and galaxies grew around them. Or perhaps the galaxies came first, and small black 
<br>holes within them merged and fed on gas, dust, and stars, eventually becoming the monsters they are today. Exploring 
<br>this question is a major goal for NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope.</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
The two populations of stars are a result of the way that our galaxy formed. Initially the galaxy was a great ball of gas and 
<br>dust. This ball may have formed as a large cloud, or it may have formed by the accretion of smaller clouds that possibly had 
<br>already made a generation of stars. The first stars that formed were spherically distributed, and because the initial cloud 
<br>was spinning slowly the stars formed in rather random orbits within the initially spherical galaxy. This early generation of 
<br>spherically distributed stars become the present Pop II; they were low in metals because little star formation had preceded them.

<p style="font-family:Arial; color:night">
As the galaxy flattened and began to spin faster the star-forming material concentrated in the disk, so most newer star formation has 
<br>occurred there. These newer disk stars, which constitute Pop I, are richer in metals because of the stellar evolution associated with 
<br>earlier generations of stars. They also were likely to be formed in more circular orbits confined to the disk because of the more 
<br>rapid rotation of the galaxy as it contracted.</p>
